Chatbot from Scratch in Python:

A chatbot is software based on artificial intelligence in a device (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, etc.), an application, a website or other networks that try to meet the needs of consumers and then help them to perform a specific task, such as a business transaction, hotel reservation, form submission.

The history of chatbots dates back to 1966 when a computer program called ELIZA was invented by Weizenbaum. He imitated the language of a psychotherapist from just 200 lines of code.

On similar lines, create a very basic chatbot using Python NLTK library. It is a very simple bot with almost no cognitive skills, but still a good way to get into NLP and get to know chatbot.
